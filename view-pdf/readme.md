## Prerequisites:
Node.js is required to build and run this sample. 
Node.js can be installed from https://nodejs.org/ (you may need to restart your command prompt or IDE afterwards).

## Follow these steps to build and run the sample:
1. Extract the files from the downloaded zip to a directory on your computer.
2. Navigate to that directory.
3. Run the **run.cmd** batch file. This will build the sample sources, start the SupportApi service and open the http://localhost:3003 URL in your default browser.

## Alternative steps for building and running the sample manually:
1. Extract the files from the downloaded zip to a directory on your computer.
2. Navigate to that directory.
2. Run the **supportapi.cmd** batch file. This will extract the SupportApi service sources to the WebApi directory, build and start the service. (To stop the service, press **Ctrl+C**.)
3. Open another command prompt in the same directory and run **npm install** to install package dependencies.
5. Run the sample with **npm start**. Visit http://localhost:3003 to see the sample in action. (To stop the sample, press **Ctrl+C**.)
